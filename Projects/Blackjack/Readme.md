# Blackjack Game

A simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. Play against the computer and try to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over!

## Features

- Simulates a standard Blackjack game between a user and the computer.
- Handles Ace values (11 or 1) automatically.
- Detects Blackjack, busts, and draws.
- ASCII art logo for a fun interface.
- Replay option after each game.

## How to Play

1. Run the script [`blackjack.py`](blackjack.py).
2. You and the computer are each dealt two cards.
3. Your cards and one of the computer's cards are shown.
4. Choose to draw another card (`y`) or end your turn.
5. The computer draws cards until its score is at least 17.
6. The winner is determined based on standard Blackjack rules.

## Rules

- Number cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
- Ace can be worth 11 or 1, depending on which is more favorable.
- Blackjack is when the first two cards total 21.
- If your score exceeds 21, you bust and lose.
- If both you and the computer have the same score, it's a draw.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

```sh
python blackjack.py

Follow the prompts in the terminal to play.

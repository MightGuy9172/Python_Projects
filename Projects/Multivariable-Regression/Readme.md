This project analyzes the Boston housing dataset using multivariable regression techniques. The goal is to estimate property prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, distance to employment centers, accessibility to highways, and socioeconomic factors.

Key steps include:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Building and evaluating a regression model
- Interpreting model coefficients and residuals
- Using the model to estimate property prices

Libraries used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn.

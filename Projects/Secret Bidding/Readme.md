# 🕵️ Secret Bidding Program

A fun Python-based **secret bidding** game built for the command line. This simple program collects bids from multiple users without revealing them until the end — then announces the highest bidder as the winner!

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Take multiple participant bids **secretly**.
- Clear the screen after each bidder inputs their data.
- At the end, display **the winner with the highest bid**.

Great for beginners to learn:

- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Functions
- Working with the terminal/console

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🧠 Basic control structures (loops, conditionals)
- 🗃️ `dictionary` to store bids
- 🧼 `os.system('clear')` / `cls` to hide previous inputs (platform dependent)

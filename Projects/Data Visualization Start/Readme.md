# Data Visualization: Programming Languages Popularity

This project analyzes and visualizes the popularity of various programming languages over time using StackOverflow data.

## Features

- Loads and processes data from a CSV file exported from StackExchange.
- Uses Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.
- Explores trends in programming language usage by number of posts.
- Provides rolling averages and time series plots for selected languages.

## Usage

1. Download the CSV file from [StackExchange Query](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/675441/popular-programming-languages-per-over-time-eversql-com).
2. Place the CSV file in the project directory.
3. Open `Programming_Languages_(start).ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
4. Run the notebook cells to explore and visualize the data.

## Requirements
